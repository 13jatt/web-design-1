// HOMEWORK 4
// Create a program showing a specific message:
// -----------------------------------------------------
// | Age range | Comment example                      |
// | 1 to 17   | You are not a major yet.             |
// | 18 to 49  | You are major, but not senior yet.   |

// COURSE 4:
// WHAT ARE LOOPS?
// ITS TYPES?: while, do-while, for

// Start from 1
// alert("Hello");
// End from 5001


// Exercise 6:
// Display "Hello" 4 times to the user.
// alert("Hello");
// alert("Hello");
// alert("Hello");
// alert("Hello");


// Exercise 7:
// Display "Hello" 10 times to the user by using while loop.
// start -> 1 and end -> 10
var i = 1;
while(i <= 10){   // start -> 1 and i is smaller than or equal to 10
    alert("Hello"); // Actual code. i = 1
    i = i + 1; // i = 1 + 1 => i = 2
} // i = 2 stop & go to start at line 42 


// Homework 5:
// Display "Bonjour" 25 times to the user by using while loop.
// start -> 1 and end -> 25
